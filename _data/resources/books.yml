    Very in-depth book on Scrapy. It shows Scrapy 1.0.x, and is Python 2 only.

    It explains practically every component and setting to get you started with Scrapy,
    and dive deeper if needed.
    There's [a very cool example of asynchronous sending of items](https://github.com/scalingexcellence/scrapy-apperyio/blob/master/scrapyapperyio.py),
    using `engine.download` and `inlineCallback`.
    It also shows how to deploy a Scrapy project to Zyte Scrapy Cloud.
    The book even includes a quite intense introduction to Twisted
    and nonblocking I/O programming (a very good one).

    The book has a [companion website](http://scrapybook.com/)
    which has videos for some chapters.

    This book is not only about Scrapy but it has a whole chapter on Scrapy,
    “Chapter 6. Heavyweight Scraping with Scrapy”.

    It suggests using Anaconda, but make sure to use conda-forge channel instead.
    There's a nice introduction to XPath and how to use scrapy shell to test selectors.
    It also introduces `ImagesPipeline` to grab Nobel Prize winners pics,
    which is pretty cool, right?
